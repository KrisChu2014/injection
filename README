Direct Code Injection of Linux ELF Executable File 

=== INTRODUCTION ===

The included code snippets demonstrate an approach to inject compiled code fragment 
directly into ELF binary executable file to be called when the executable file is invoked.

=== SOURCE CODE & API ===

installer.S
 The code to be injected 
 
hook.c
 ApiHook_Init(char *)
	- read the ELF file and load into memory file's section header information
   
 ApiHook_InstallHooker(void)
	- read in-memory section header information
	- inject code from installer.S
	
 ApiHook_SymbolRelo(char *)	
    - translate symbol's file offset with respect to the beginning of a file into 
	  the memory offset after the file is loaded in memory for execution.
	  
 ApiHook_ElfHdrCheck(char *)
	- file format consistency check, to make sure the file conforms to ELF format.
	
=== TESTING ===
	
reader.c
  reads the modified ELF file and output injected code location.

=== BUILD ===
gcc -o api installer.S hook.c
gcc -o check reader.c
